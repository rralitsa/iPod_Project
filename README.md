Hello, this is a digital iPod that features three different Hannah Montana songs. The first key you must select is the up arrow key to turn on the iPod, to turn it off you press the down arrow key. The space bar functionality works as a play and pause button for the two active songs on the iPod. The third song is a hidden surprise feature, purposely not mentioned on the tracklist, which can be discovered by the user when the mouse is clicked within the parameters of the tracklist guide (and to pause or resume that same song you must click once again within those dimensions). For now, those are all the functions this interactive visual item has to offer! I was running into trouble adding more songs but in the future, I hope to complete it so that all nine of the songs on the tracklist can be played. Thank you and enjoy listening to this nostalgic digital time capsule!
